# passwordy

This is a random password genorator. Its probably the worst code I have ever writen and I would not blame you if you thought it was disgusting.
infact it is so bad that i didn't even have will to comment it propurly

## How to use
But to use it is pretty self explanitory it promts you on what to do most of the time 

## Issues
There are still acouple of things I must do such as..:

#### Must be fixed
- [ ] the word count prompt is not very discriptive on what the rules are
- [ ] if you click strong and then very strong without clicking yes or no (to gen the password) you get a wierd overlap affect wich is not desired
- [ ] I should comment the code better <br>
But atleast it shouldn't crash on you

#### Not that big a deal
- [ ] The window looks a bit ugly it would be nice to style it better
- [ ] The previeas number is still in the text box when you next call the function for strong

## In development

I do intend to fix every thing on this list
